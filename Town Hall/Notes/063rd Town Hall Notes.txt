1 - INTRODUCTION -
Hello and welcome everybody to the 63rd Town Hall Meeting! I'm glad you are all
here today, so lets get right into things. Last Sunday I had a talk with some
of the Admins and Mods and I came to realize I'm spending too much time on
writing the Guidelines, and not enough time talking to you guys and teaching
you guys about what it's even suppose to do. I'm not going to halt writing the
damn thing, but I'm gonna write less and share my ideas with you all instead.

I know enough about Gaming Communities to write a 200 page book. It's extensive
and it'd be more effective if I told you guys instead of forcing you to read a
document. Though I've been so focused on writing the thing because many groups
that never get passed that 1 year mark is BECAUSE they don't have something
that's writen down that's followed seriously. I mean groups of a 100 people
with not even a basic writen Code.

So now we have made though the first year. I've started the basic foundation
of ideas this group need to follow, and I want to make sure that you guys get
it. A ton of guys have come up to me and asked "What can I do to help JSG
become the best gaming community ever made?" And I would say something like
"Just wait for me to finish the Guidelines and I'll be right with you." NO that
is not how this is going to work.

BUT we cannot ignore it and just never write the Guidelines. This is why I have
got into this whole Github thing. Github will enable you guys to have full
control over the critical documents in this community. From the source files of
logos and banners to the text of the Code and Guidelines. I accept all the
changes on Git and now I'm calling out to you guys who want to help out!

2 - GAME PLAN -
So here's the GAME PLAN:
- I'm going to focus first on bringing up our servers. We now have exactly $100
and 30 cents in the Paypal and first I'm going to get a small linux box to host
Mumble Music Bots. Once that's up you can subscribe for $10 a month to get your
own channel that you can edit, and I'll supply the server and configure a Music
Bot with you. You can name the bot and you get Admin commands over your bot.

This is what we need, and I'm very sorry that this has taken so long but I was
so fucking focused on making sure that we got past that critical first year to
cement and mark that we are not going anywhere.

- Next is realted to Git, all of the Mumble propoganda, all of the crazy shit
we say on recording we have, pictures, documents, whatever needs to be
collected and put there. No other community freaking uses Git, but we will take
advantage of it so that we can easily share all the images and recordings that
have made up this community. Like how many people have actually read WooZii's
fan fic named "MrNalocible"? That shit goes onto the JSG Git. The Mumble image
I made that says "I can still see, that you're not on Mumble." goes onto the
Git. PUT ALL THE THINGS ON THE GIT.

- Finally, I'm gonna stop writing the Guidelines so I can focus on these
things. I'll still make edits, but when you have a "Late Night Conversation
With Krucible" you are usually gonna be listening to things that should go into
the Guidelines. I'd just would rather have the first Guidelines actually writen
by the people who are following it, and be authored by anybody willing to so
much as contribute one idea; because that's one more idea closer to perfection.

Now, some of you are sitting here going DAMN like a black chick saying, I gonna
have to listen to the fucking recording for this shit. This guy is handing me
shit to do but I'm high as fuck right now. I'm seeing unicorns and this guys is
going VIVA LA REVOLUTION and I don't know what the fuck. Just stay with me here
and listen. I'm gonna start telling the Mods and Hosts what the hell to do
personally and from there I want you guys to write out your experiences.

This way everybody gets on the same page as to what the hell you needs to get
done. Stuff like Mumble Etiquette doesn't infect people like Aids, instead of
a sore ass you get a headache. So all of the ideas of this community need to
be spread and it all depends really of what I tell you guys and how often you
edit the Guidelines and that Git. Hell, now you can edit the Town Hall notes
and add announcements and things to add of your own.

3 - FIRST ORDER OF BUISNESS -
So the first order of buisness is to normalize the Mumble. Some guys arn't
getting on for whatever reason, I need the Hosts and Mods to find the guys who
are getting IN-GAME but not in mumble; breaking the 5th Code, and ask them to
hop on Mumble. Don't interrogate them just tell a Mod or Admin what you found
out. This man was not getting on Mumble because his testicals were stuck in the
DVD tray. He screamed like a girl and has one serious case of blue balls.
That guy we can have sympathy for, and the guys who just don't have a ton of
time in there day to play with everyone.

The next thing is while I'm getting server buisness handled we can't just focus
on our current members: it's long overdue but I'm gonna ask you to get on the
hunt for some new members. Just look in your friends list or just introduce the
really cool guys you know to the Mumble. If we focused on just bringing in some
Dudes in here, like from the Big Libouwski, like 5 or 10 Dudeorinos holding on
some diritos all just chilling. Lets get those guys into the Mumble, lets get
those guys because they're usually too high to understand what the hell you are
even asking them. "Oh Mumble, yea man whatever I'll get it. Just don't forget
the diritos." Then it chain reacts and he gets more dudes on!

# - OPEN DISCUSSIONS


# - EPIC PARTY NIGHT
Game Night is becoming a program. You can commit to coming to Game Night and
every week you make a vote 


new members. Not going into a lobby and recruiting because we only want people
we like in here. It doesn't help inviting someone who's never gonna get on and gets along with nobody but
you. Sounds like Counter Strike elitists to me.

I think I can live with it. So what I'm gonna need now is help from
you guys. Serious help because now that I'm taking my focus off of it someone
else need to work on it. The reason we even need the Guid


















































Hello and welcome everybody to the 63rd Town Hall Meeting! I'm getting ready for this
next year and starting to think about some of the things I'd like to do with the
community. Set up some servers, makes some more friends, teach and learn some git tools;
but I'm gonna have to let go of one thing and that's Guidelines. First let me clarify
that I they will still be written, but at a much slower pace. I've been led to believe
though my study of other groups that many groups failed because they didn't have some
basic Code or Guidelines to follow. That's true, but not necessarily in our case.

I've been so focused on completing the Guidelines that I lost sight of some common things
like making Game Night fun. The reason why Game Night was so much fun long ago was
because I spent time planning out the event thoroughly, and I've shifted that focus to
the Guidelines. Now we need the Guidelines, we literally can't live without it so that
nothing goes misunderstood as far as responsibilities go;

  So let me
first clarify that this does not mean that I'm no longer going to stop writing the thing:
it means that I'm going to be spending drastically less time on it, because I realize now
that it's more effective for me to just tell you guys.

And it has also been hurting us. The Moderators and Hosts don't know what the hell to
start doing right now because I havn't given out any orders or operation plans or THINGS
TO WORK ON. It was two nights ago, Sunday that I was encountered by Jman and Damaleus and
they told me that stuff isn't getting done and we're just sitting ducks right now. That's
when I realized that I became too fixated to completing the Guidelines, and I'm sorry.

Though with my study of other groups, if there's no "Code" or "Guidelines" the group can
easily fall apart because people split due to misunderstood ideas; and there's no sense
of who's in charge. But that's kinda where we are at right now, and it's very simple on
how to get out of it. I need to stop writing the Guidelines and focus on teaching you
guys what I want put in it. So this is why we have the Github. So from now I when I
teach you something and you feel like that's something that should be added into the
Guidelines, you must edit that into our Guidelines or I'll help you with it.

I'd rather have the Guidelines authored by the people following it rather than myself,
even though I'm an author you guys can have much more to add. Sometimes I've hear stuff
I've never would of thought about, suggestions just from sitting with you guys in the
chats and I'd go "Oh my god, that'd be perfect to add into the Guidelines!" I want you
guys to have that same reaction, and passion if you can, for building this community.
I know enough to write a 200 page book on gaming communities, but it would take so damn
long because I've quite frankly never wrote a fuckin' book before.

2 - GAME PLAN -
So now guys here's the Game Plan:
- I'm gonna start focusing more on talking and sharing ideas with you guys rather than
writing them down. I'd rather have you guys take the responsibility of helping write it
with me instead of doing it on my own.
- Next, this is the big changer
