Gather around all ye children!

 I am about to tell you of a civilization that is long past. I am about to tell you the legend of CCG

In the Ancient times CCG was born, a great nation of gold and gems.

 However as time had went on the great leader of this group had stolen the Great Artifact of this nation, and due to this catastrophe the great civilization of CCG had fallen.

In later ages a new civilization arose from the ashes of CCG, this nation was rumored to be called 1STS and had become a great nation, that was unified from the fall of CCG.

But, as history has to tell this great civilization had fallen into arguments, although the great tipping point of the fall of 1STS was when one of the great leaders ViewtifulJoe had left this once great nation.

And so with the fall of two great nations, finally Just Some Gamers had arosen from the ashes of the greatly flawed civilizations led by the great leader MrKrucible, and has survived till this day.

You may ask of how this great nation has survived all this time?

Well when freedom and friendship take judgement of a great nation, that nation may live on forever...
