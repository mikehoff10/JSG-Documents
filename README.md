JSG-Documents | Town Hall Branch
=============
##What you will find here:
- Town Hall Notes, Recordings, and Attendence pictures.
- The weekly Suggestion Box file.

###Suggestion Box File
This file is where members can put in their own ideas and questions to be discussed during Town Hall Meetings.

1. Fork over JSG-Documents.
2. Change the branch you are on from <code>master</code> to <code>townhall</code>
3. Edit the <code>box.txt<code> and add what you want to bring up.
3.1. Make sure to add a commit, or note saying what you have added.
4. Create a pull request and it'll be added to the main box.txt file.

###Old Suggestions
This folder contains one <code>oldbox.txt</code> that has all the previously suggested ideas with their answers.

**Note: This branch WILL NOT BE MERGED with the master branch. This is strictly a place for Town Hall documents. It may be merged into it's own repository later on, but for now it's easier to leave it on a branch.**
